In this article I will try to describe how to make the renovation of your dreams in your apartment.
My goal is to create a general instruction (template) that allows you to make renovation in almost any room.
That is why I will not do deep into the details of each process, but only go over them superficially so that
the instructions are as universal as possible.

Instruction:

1. Make a list of materials and buy them from a hardware store.
2. Remove all things from the room if possible, cover the rest with a protective film
3. Start painting the ceiling
4. Take a selfie of how you work and post the photo on Instagram so that everyone can see what a hard worker you are.
5. Take a Lunch Break
6. Continue painting the ceiling
7. Get angry because you're not doing well and because it turned out harder than you thought
8. Take a Lunch Break
9. Once the paint wii be dry, notice that you paint the ceiling unevenly. It means that the ceiling needs to be repainted
10. Get angry a second time
11. Hire a good specialist or ask your friend with experience to help you.
